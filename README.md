**What does Bookmarking a word do?**

Bookmarking a word will add it to your home screen and save it to your device (making it accessible offline). This gives you the ability to revisit words that you're familiarizing or learning.

**What is the Archive section for?**

When a bookmarked word is no longer of interest to you, you can have it moved into the archive section. Words that have been archived will be retrievable based on the year / month of when it was archived.

**What are Phrases?**

Phrases are sentences containing a particular word. Phrases should provide you with better context of how a word is used in a sentence. Create and view phrases for words you are learning to improve your understanding of a word. You can make your phrases public or private (account required).
